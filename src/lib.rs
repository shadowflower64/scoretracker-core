//!
//! This crate specifically will include components 1..=5 and 11..=12. Components 6..=10 will be separate, but built upon the `scoretracker_core` library.
//!
//! # Glossary
//! Here is some of the terminology used in "scoretracker":
//! - **Chart** - A set of notes that the player must play.
//! - **Library item** (name wip) - An entry in the [`library`].
//!   One *library item* represents a unique file in the library.
//!   Duplicate files (files with the same SHA256 hash) are considered the same library item.
//!   For that reason, a library item can have multiple locations/paths recorded in it.
//! - **Performance** - One play of one player on one chart of a song, with a given difficulty level, an instrument, and a score.
//! - **Proof** - A library item that proves a performance is real.
//! - **Score** - Numerical amount of points usually displayed at the end of a song.
//! - **Song** - A song in a rhythm game. One song can have multiple charts (for example, different difficulties, or different instruments).
