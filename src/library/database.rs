//! Library database file handling.
//!
//! A library database file is a file shared globally across libraries, that maps "proof UUIDs" to actual information and metadata about the proof.
//! Every entry in a library database file contains information about the SHA256 hash of the proof file, the type of the file (recording, screenshot etc.),
//! the modification timestamps of the file, the state of the file (is it linked to any score? is it uploaded), as well as other information.

/// Naming of quality states and actions that change the quality state is based on the analogy of storing physical paper documents:
/// * The first state of a video is [`QualityState::Raw`] - this is a video file that has been taken straight from the recording software, without any additional processing.
/// * You can "preserve" a video to keep it in its [`QualityState::Raw`] state.
/// * You can "fold" a video and it will become a [`QualityState::Folded`] video.
///   A folded video is pretty much visually lossless, and it takes up a lot less space, just like a folded sheet of paper.
/// * You can "crumple" the video and it will become a [`QualityState::Crumpled`] video.
///   A crumpled video is visibly lossily compressed, but takes up a whole lot less space
/// * You can "shred" the video and it will become a [`QualityState::Shredded`] video.
///   A shredded video is compressed to a terrible quality, but it will take up a very small amount of space, usually under 3 MiB.
///
/// Additionally, you can also:
/// * "trash" the video - which means it won't be processed, and will be moved straight to the system trash, and
/// * "delete" the video - which means it will be `rm`'d from the filesystem entirely, without even going to trash.
///
/// These actions are traditionally applied to the "raw" video only, but theoretically more destructive actions can be used on already folded or crumpled videos.
