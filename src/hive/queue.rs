/// A queue of tasks that are to be executed by workers.
///
/// Tasks in this queue are taken on and executed by workers ([`crate::hive::worker::Worker`]).
/// You can implement your own worker processes (in any programming language),
/// but to make sure that no data is lost and no duplicate work is done, please follow the process described below:
///
/// If you want to add a task to the queue:
/// 1. Lock the queue file (the process of locking a file is described in the [`crate::util::lockfile`] module).
/// 2. Read the queue file (jsonlines format) (this is technically optional, as with jsonlines you can add new entries without parsing the whole file).
/// 3. Append a new entry with a unique UUID to the end of the file.
/// 4. Write to the queue file.
/// 5. Unlock the queue file.
///
/// If you want to execute a task in the queue:
/// 1. Lock the queue file.
/// 2. Read the queue file (jsonlines format).
/// 3. Find a task to do, either by an externally provided UUID, or by just choosing one of the tasks.
/// 4. Make sure the state of the task is set to [`TaskState::Queued`].
///    If it is not, then that means that the task is being executed by another process, or it is already done.
/// 5. Set the state of the task to [`TaskState::Working`]
/// 6. Set the [`Task::start_timestamp`] and [`Task::worker_info`] fields of the task to correct values.
/// 7. Save the updated task info to the queue file.
/// 8. Unlock the queue file.
/// 9. Execute the job described in the task.
///    After the task is finished (with either a failure or a success state), continue with the steps below.
/// 10. Lock the queue file.
/// 11. Read the queue file again (it may have changed by now!).
/// 12. Find the task with the same UUID as before.
/// 13. Update the task's state to [`TaskState::Done`] or [`TaskState::Failed`].
/// 14. If the task was successful, update the [`Task::result`] field to the result of the task.
/// 15. Update the [`Task::finish_timestamp`] field to the current timestamp.
/// 16. Save the updated task info to the queue file.
/// 17. Unlock the queue file.
