/// A lockfile handle.
///
/// A lockfile is like a warning to other programs and processes, that says - if you write to this file, your changes will most likely be lost.
/// If every process involved uses the same lockfile system, then the system guarantees that only one process at a time has access to the files.
///
/// The lockfile is based on the provided path, with a `.lockfile` suffix appended to it.
/// For example, for a file called `./directory/subdir/test.txt`, the path `./directory/subdir/test.txt.lockfile`.
///
/// Here is how this safety guard process works:
/// 1. The lockfile is created. If the same file existed already, the opening process fails and exits out early.
///    This has to be an atomic process - it is important that the check for the file's existence is NOT separate from the creation of the file.
///    Checking first and then creating the file would create a TOCTOU race condition issue.
///    Thankfully, we can use Rust's [`File::create_new`] function to achieve atomicity.
/// 2. The main file is read, using usual [`std::fs`] methods.
///    We can do this safely, knowing that other processes won't read the file for writing at the same time, for as long as this process' lockfile exists.
/// 3. The read data is processed or modified.
/// 4. The processed data is written to the file.
///    Again - since the lockfile still exists, this guarantees that other processes using this system do not overwrite the file.
/// 5. After writing is finished, the lockfile is removed. This frees up any other processes to take over the file again.
///
/// NOTE: DO NOT CLONE - Owning an instance of this structure represents unique ownership of the associated. It should never be cloned.
